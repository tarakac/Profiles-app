# Profiles App

This is a simple React application built using **Vite** and **React-Bootstrap**.  

## Features implemented so far

1. **Project setup**  
   - Initialized a **Vite + React** project inside a VS Code dev container with Node.js.
   - Dev server configured to run with `--host` for container compatibility.

2. **React-Bootstrap integration**  
   - Installed `react-bootstrap` and `bootstrap`.
   - Imported Bootstrap CSS in `src/main.jsx`.

3. **Hello React page**  
   - Replaced `<App />` content with a React-Bootstrap `Alert` component displaying **"Hello React"**.
   - Wrapped the alert in a Bootstrap `Container` with padding for proper spacing.
